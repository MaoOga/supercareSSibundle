## Testing the System

Run the test script to verify email notifications are working:

```bash
php test_backup_email.php
```

This will:

1. Test success email notifications
2. Test error email notifications
3. Verify email configuration
4. Show test results

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Notifications

In `backup_system.php`, you can control email notifications:

```php
$enableEmail = true; // Set to false to disable all email notifications
```

### Change Notification Recipients

To send notifications to different email addresses, modify in `backup_system.php`:

```php
$emailTo = 'admin@yourhospital.com'; // Change to desired email
```

### Email Templates

All email templates are defined as functions in `backup_system.php`:

- `createSuccessEmailBody()`
- `createErrorEmailBody()`
- `createCleanupEmailBody()`
- `createCleanupErrorEmailBody()`

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sent

1. Check if PHPMailer is installed in the `phpmailer/` directory
2. Verify Gmail app password is correct
3. Check backup log for email delivery errors
4. Ensure `$enableEmail` is set to `true`

### Gmail Issues

1. Make sure 2-factor authentication is enabled on Gmail account
2. Generate a new app password if needed
3. Check Gmail account settings for SMTP access
4. Verify the app password has no spaces

### Template Issues

1. Check email template functions for syntax errors
2. Verify HTML structure in email templates
3. Test with the provided test script

## Logging

All email notification attempts are logged in `backup_log.log`:

- Success: "Email notification sent to [email]"
- Failure: "Failed to send email: [error details]"

## Best Practices

1. **Test Regularly**: Run the test script monthly to ensure notifications work
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check backup logs for email delivery issues
3. **Update Recipients**: Keep notification email addresses current
4. **Review Templates**: Update email content as needed for your organization
5. **Backup Verification**: Always verify backup files after receiving success notifications

## Security Notes

- Email notifications contain backup metadata but not actual backup files
- Gmail app passwords are more secure than regular passwords
- Professional "from" address helps with email deliverability
- No sensitive patient data is included in email content

## Support

If you encounter issues with email notifications:

1. Check the backup log for detailed error messages
2. Run the test script to isolate email issues
3. Verify Gmail account settings and app passwords
4. Contact system administrator for assistance
