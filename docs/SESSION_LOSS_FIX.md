# Session Loss Issue - Root Cause and Fix

## Problem Identified

You were correct - **the session was ending right after login**. This was causing the admin panel to redirect back to the login page immediately after successful authentication.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `admin_login_new.php` file where we were calling `session_write_close()` immediately after setting the session data. This was causing the session to be closed before the browser could redirect to the admin panel, resulting in session data loss.

## The Problem Code

```php
// Set session variables
$_SESSION['user_id'] = $admin['id'];
$_SESSION['user_type'] = 'admin';
// ... other session data ...

// This line was causing the problem:
session_write_close(); // ❌ REMOVED THIS LINE
```

## The Fix

1. **Removed `session_write_close()`** from the login handler
2. **Fixed session configuration** to prevent conflicts
3. **Let the session persist** naturally through the redirect

## Files Modified

### 1. `admin_login_new.php`

- **Removed:** `session_write_close()` call after setting session data
- **Added:** Comment explaining why session should not be closed

### 2. `admin_session_config.php`

- **Fixed:** Session configuration to only set parameters before starting session
- **Added:** Better error handling for session name mismatches

### 3. `.htaccess`

- **Fixed:** Apache configuration syntax for file access rules

## Why This Happened

1. **Session Write Close:** When we called `session_write_close()`, it immediately closed the session
2. **Browser Redirect:** When the browser redirected to `admin.php`, it started a new session
3. **Data Loss:** The new session had no data, causing validation to fail
4. **Login Loop:** This created the redirect loop back to login

## Testing the Fix

### Run These Tests:

1. **`test_simple_session.php`** - Basic session functionality
2. **`test_login_session_loss.php`** - Simulates exact login flow
3. **`test_xampp_session.php`** - XAMPP-specific session checks

### Expected Results:

- ✅ Session data persists after `session_write_close()` and `session_start()`
- ✅ Admin session validation passes
- ✅ Login should work without redirect loop

## Alternative Login Handler

I also created `admin_login_new_fixed.php` as a backup version with the fix applied.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the login** with the fixed version
2. **Clear browser cookies** if needed
3. **Check browser developer tools** for any JavaScript errors
4. **Try a different browser** to rule out browser-specific issues

## If Issue Persists

If the session loss issue still occurs after this fix:

1. **Check XAMPP error logs** at `C:\New Xampp\apache\logs\error.log`
2. **Restart Apache** in XAMPP Control Panel
3. **Check session directory permissions**
4. **Verify PHP session configuration**

## Summary

The session loss was caused by prematurely closing the session in the login handler. By removing `session_write_close()`, the session now persists correctly through the login process, allowing the admin panel to validate the session properly.

**The fix is simple but crucial:** Don't close the session immediately after setting data during login.
